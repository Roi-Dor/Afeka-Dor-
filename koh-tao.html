                    Koh Tao is a small island in the Gulf of Thailand known for its quiet beaches
                    and turquoise water. It’s one of the most popular places in the world for diving
                    and snorkeling thanks to its coral reefs and colorful marine life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The island has a relaxed vibe, with beach bars, quiet bays, and viewpoints
                    that overlook the entire coastline — especially beautiful at sunset.
