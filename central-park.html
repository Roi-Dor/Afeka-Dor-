                    Central Park is a massive urban park located right in the heart of Manhattan.
                    It’s a place where you can forget you're in one of the busiest cities in the world.
                    With lakes, long walking paths, huge lawns, and street performers,
                    the park is full of life all year round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes it special is the contrast between nature and skyscrapers.
                    You can look up from almost anywhere in the park and see New York’s skyline
                    rising above the trees — a unique mix of calm and excitement.
