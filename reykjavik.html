                <p>
                    Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, is a small yet charming city known for
                    its colorful houses, scenic harbor, and the iconic Hallgrímskirkja church.
                    It has a calm, cool atmosphere with beautiful natural views all around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the city, you can easily reach Iceland’s dramatic landscapes:
                    glaciers, geysers, waterfalls, and — with luck — the northern lights
                    glowing in the winter sky.
