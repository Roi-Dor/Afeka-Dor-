                <p>
                    Machu Picchu is an ancient Inca settlement perched high in the Andes Mountains.
                    It overlooks deep valleys and is often surrounded by drifting clouds,
                    giving the entire place a mystical atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The terraced fields, stone structures, and breathtaking mountain views make it
                    feel like stepping back in time. It’s one of those rare places that looks exactly
                    like a postcard — only the real thing is even more impressive.
                </p>
